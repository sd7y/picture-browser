# Picture Browser

The project aims to provide an online platform for browsing and managing images. The project focuses on the following key functionalities:

1. **Scanning File Directory and Listing Files**
    - The project allows scanning a specified file directory to retrieve a list of image files.
    - The listed files are presented to the user for further actions.

2. **Image Grouping by File Directory**
    - The system organizes the images into groups based on the file directories they belong to.
    - This grouping allows users to navigate and locate images more efficiently.

3. **Lazy Loading of Images**
    - To optimize performance, the project implements a technique called lazy loading.
    - Images are loaded only when they are about to be displayed to the user, reducing initial page load time.

4. **User Authorization and Permissions**
    - The system includes user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Each user has their own set of images that they have permission to view.
    - Users can only see and access their own images, ensuring privacy and data security.

By combining these functionalities, the Java Image Gallery project provides a user-friendly web interface for browsing, grouping, and managing images efficiently and securely.
